# General Support

We will try to align our support strategy with the supported platforms original support policy, in practice this means
that if the NodeJS runtime provides support only to version X and newer, we will align our support practices with it.

Unless decided otherwise by our case-by-case analysis, we will adhere to the following principles:

- We provide support for the current and two previous major versions of our SDKs.
- We will provide bug fixes and security patches for older versions of our SDKs on a case-by-case basis.
- We will provide support for versions of our SDKs with the first major version being released a year ago or not older
  than two major versions.

## Extraordinary Circumstances

In extraordinary circumstances, we may provide support for older versions of our SDKs.
Examples of extraordinary circumstances include:

- A critical security vulnerability that affects an older version of our SDK.
- A major change in the underlying platform that requires us to update an older version of our SDK.

We will evaluate requests for support in extraordinary circumstances on a case-by-case basis.

## Enforcement

We will enforce this policy unless a situation is extraordinary.

If we determine that a situation is extraordinary, we will provide support for the older version of our SDK for a limited time.

We will communicate the end of support for the older version of our SDK to users in advance.
