  /**
   *	Creates a new Cart by replicating an existing Cart or Order.
   *
   *	The following applies to the new Cart:
   *
   *	- It contains the same Customer information, Line Items and Custom Line Items, Custom Fields, Discount Codes, and other settings of the originating Cart or Order.
   *	- If a Line Item becomes invalid, it is removed from the new Cart. A common reason for this is removed Products or Prices.
   *	- Line items and Custom Line Items are reset to their initial [state](/projects/carts#itemstate).
   *	- It contains no payments or delivery information.
   *	- It contains up-to-date Tax Rates, Prices, and Line Item product data.
   *	- The [CartState](/projects/carts#cartstate) is `Active`.
   *	- If using the `customerGroup` field (for a single Customer Group) and the referenced Customer switched to another Customer Group, the new Cart is automatically updated to reflect the new group and corresponding prices.
   *	- If using the `customerGroupAssignments` field (for multiple Customer Groups), the Cart no longer keeps a direct reference to a Customer Group. If a Customerâ€™s group assignments change, the Cart and its Line Item prices are not updated automatically. Prices are only updated when the Cart is changed via a [direct update action](/projects/carts#update-actions).
   *
   *	Specific Error Codes:
   *
   *	- [MatchingPriceNotFound](ctp:api:type:MatchingPriceNotFoundError)
   *	- [MissingTaxRateForCountry](ctp:api:type:MissingTaxRateForCountryError)
